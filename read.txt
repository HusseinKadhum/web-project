1#version 1 of the website has all main sections layed out it css. We have deminsions, paddings and margins set correctly, however that leaves room for content.
Specifically menu section backgrounds (currently set to a background color.

2#The site does not function and will require JavaScript (or JQuery) to do so. The FF8 site's files, 
including js and css can be donwloaded (save-as ). This should help with script code etc but I haven't looked into that yet.

3#We will need to add more css to unfinished sections, as well as "maybe" improve the current css rules. I have inserted some comment in the css file, and the html for reference.

4#Ideas for JS, beside getting the menu to work plus the bottons on the page:
	- An age gate.
	- Maybe some js in the buy section to make it look nicer.

6#I have used a special font, called Andes.ttf. It's not a pre-installed font, but can be downloaded on user or veiwer pc if properly placed and called in css.
I have included it in the directory. It's better if you install it into your font folder but it's not absolutely necessary for you to do so.
The font was used for the menu but would also be cool if we use it for headings, titles etc. 
For the rest of the page Century Gothic is kinda Bioshocky and I've used it as a Fallback font incase we've issues with Andes.
It wouldn't be a bad idea if we used it as fallback each time we change the font family of something in css.

7#Speaking of css, some rules might seem a little iffy and complex; that's because they are. 
Some elements would not work simply because there was a space between the "." of class and the previous element in the line. (examples in css file).
Ironically, the same issue when there is no space on some elements. In other words, if it's not doing what's it's suppsed to, just remove the space before the dot and vice versa.


8#The characters section is going to need some tweaking. I've made a table and placed images in it, but haven't created any rules for the table. We should get it to work as is on the wireframe - no idea how. Probably some JS and css should do the trick.

9#Initial commits on github as of the date of this readme.

10# You will have noticed that I have made 2 folders, one labeled "ar" and the other "en", as well as the directory folder that contains the exact same files.
Basically, the idea here that we have an en and ar link on the top which link to arabic index and english index since you cannot have mutiple files named exactly the same.
Work with the files in the main directory (not ar or en), copy pase the files you changed in the ar and en directories. You can even skip this as it doesn't really matter, for now. Just make changes/add to the files in the main directory.
Having multiple folders is robably not the best way to do this..

11#The arabic version is currently just a copy of the main file. Some changes need to be made, html and css wise.

12#VERY IMPORTANT: There's some issues with the navigation menu. On a smaller screen (1600-1280 or mobile and under) the nav will sit right on top of our content. Just resize your browser screen to emulate that effect. Haven't been able to find a work around for it.
We can make it smaller and/or get it to disappear after it reaches the borders of our content so it does not sit on top. That won't look nice at all.
It's possible the content class needs to be adjusted.
